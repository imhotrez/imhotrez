<h2 align="left">About me</h2>

###

<p align="left">I became interested in IT in elementary school. At the age of 14, I learned my first language - Pascal. At university, I learned the basics of C++ and OOP. In 2013, I decided to start programming professionally, and on the advice of a friend and high professional I chose C# and the .NET platform because of the breadth of application areas and C-like syntax. Since 2014 I have been doing commercial development in C#.<br>I love JetBrains products. In the beginning I used only ReSharper, now I've completely switched to Rider and consider it the most powerful IDE for .NET development.<br><br>I am a backend developer, but my activity is not limited to this. I believe that knowledge in related fields helps me to interact effectively with other team members and to understand more fully all the mechanisms of the system being developed.<br>That's why in my free time I study frontend technologies as well, and I also like to read articles, listen to podcasts and watch videos about DevOps, machine learning, functional programming and just about languages and technologies I haven't encountered yet.<br><br>I had time to work on different projects and came to the conclusion that it is more enjoyable for me to work on a single product or a family of products. To design, improve and develop its architecture, code base and expand its functionality.<br>That's why I am looking for a job in a strong product company with which I can plan long-term cooperation, with the possibility of further development and mutual benefits.<br>The most important things for me in an employer are: financial stability, well-built processes and a cool, friendly team.<br><br>Translated with DeepL.com (free version)</p>
